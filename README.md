### GPT Language Model for Text and PDF Data

This project trains a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model on text or PDF files. The model learns the patterns and structure of the input data and can then generate text that mimics the style and content of the original data.

#### Features

* **Data Versatility:** Processes both `.txt` and `.pdf` files.
* **Data Cleaning:** Normalizes and cleans text data to improve model performance.
* **Customizable Tokenization:** Supports character-level and subword-level tokenization (BPE).
* **Transformer Architecture:** Leverages a multi-head attention transformer for powerful text generation.
* **Gradient Accumulation:** Enables effective training with larger batch sizes or limited GPU memory.
* **Multiprocessing:**  Utilizes multiple processes for data loading and training efficiency.
* **Validation and Learning Rate Scheduling:**  Evaluates model performance on a validation set and adjusts the learning rate dynamically.

#### How to Use

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install torch PyPDF2 tokenizers pandas
   ```

2. **Prepare Data:**
   * Ensure your data is in `.txt` or `.pdf` format.

3. **Train the Model:**
   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py <path_to_your_data_file>
   ```

4. **Generate Text:**
   * The script will prompt you to enter a starting text, and the model will generate text based on it.

#### Configuration (Optional)

* You can modify hyperparameters such as batch size, block size, learning rate, etc., in the script's configuration section.

#### Code Structure

* **Hyperparameters:** Defines settings for training and model architecture.
* **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Extracts text, cleans it, and tokenizes for model input.
* **Model Definition:**  Implements the GPT language model with transformer blocks.
* **Training and Evaluation:**  Trains the model, evaluates on validation data, and adjusts learning rate.
* **Text Generation:** Provides a function to generate text based on a starting context.

#### Important Notes

* Requires a CUDA-capable GPU for optimal performance.
* Training large models can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
* Consider using gradient accumulation if you encounter out-of-memory errors.

### Code Analysis: Key Aspects

* **Tokenization Flexibility:** The ability to choose between character-level and subword (BPE) tokenization makes the model adaptable to different types of text data. BPE can be particularly useful for languages with rich morphology or technical texts.

* **Gradient Accumulation:**  By accumulating gradients over multiple batches before updating model weights, this technique allows for effective training even when limited GPU memory prevents using larger batch sizes directly.

* **Multiprocessing for Data Loading:**  Using multiple processes to load and preprocess data can significantly speed up the training process, especially when dealing with large datasets.

* **Validation and Learning Rate Scheduling:**  Regularly evaluating the model on a validation set and adjusting the learning rate based on validation loss helps prevent overfitting and can lead to better model performance.

* **Modular Design:** The code is well-structured into logical components, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend.
